The purpose of this repository is to explore the class project which set out to create a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network.
The virtual network had a number of key features which include the following

Jump box

Web servers
Elk Server

Each of these environments were part of virtual networks. The primary network is the one related to Red Team which hosted the jumpbox,webservers and load balancers. The Elk Server resided on a different zone.
